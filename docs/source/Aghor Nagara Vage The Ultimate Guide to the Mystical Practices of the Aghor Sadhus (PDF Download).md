## Aghor Nagara Vage: A Journey into the World of Aghoris
 
One of the most intriguing aspects of *Aghor Nagara Vage* is that it gives the reader a glimpse into the world of the Aghoris, a sect of Hindu ascetics who follow a radical and unconventional path to enlightenment. The Aghoris are not a new phenomenon, but have been around for at least a thousand years, tracing their roots to the K√Ñ¬Åp√Ñ¬Ålika tradition, a Tantric form of Shaivism that emerged in medieval India. [1] [2]
 
The Aghoris worship Shiva in his fierce form of Bhairava, and his consort Kali, the goddess of death and destruction. They believe that all opposites are ultimately illusory, and that by transcending the conventional boundaries of purity and impurity, good and evil, life and death, they can attain liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. [1] [2] [3]
 
To achieve this goal, the Aghoris practice various rituals that are considered taboo and repulsive by mainstream Hinduism. They live in cremation grounds, where they meditate on corpses and consume human flesh and ashes. They also use human skulls and bones as ornaments and utensils. They smoke marijuana and drink alcohol as part of their worship. They perform sexual acts with corpses or menstruating women in order to harness the power of kundalini. They also seek contact with spirits and ghosts, whom they regard as their teachers and guides. [1] [2] [3]
 
### Aghor Nagara Vage: A Testimony of Faith and Courage
 
*Aghor Nagara Vage* is not a mere sensational account of the Aghori practices, but a testimony of faith and courage by the author, Mohanlal Agrawal. He was not an Aghori himself, but a devout Hindu who was fascinated by their way of life. He spent many years traveling across India, meeting and interviewing various Aghoris, witnessing their rituals, and learning from their wisdom. He also faced many dangers and challenges along the way, such as being attacked by wild animals, threatened by criminals, and harassed by authorities. [4] [5]
 
Through his book, Agrawal wanted to share his insights and experiences with the readers, and to dispel some of the myths and misconceptions about the Aghoris. He also wanted to show that behind their shocking appearance and behavior, there was a profound philosophy and spirituality that deserved respect and admiration. He wrote with honesty, compassion, and curiosity, without judging or sensationalizing the Aghoris. He also wrote with humility, acknowledging his own limitations and doubts. [4] [5]
 
*Aghor Nagara Vage* is a rare and remarkable book that offers a unique perspective on one of the most mysterious and misunderstood sects of Hinduism. It is a book that challenges the reader to question their own beliefs and prejudices, and to explore the hidden dimensions of reality and spirituality.
